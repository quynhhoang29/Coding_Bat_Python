# Coding_Bat_Python
This repository contains solutions to the problems under the python section on Coding Bat. For the last problems, I used object-oriented programming after reviewing the concept. For these last problems, I was inspired by my previous experiences with computer architecture, specifically logic gates, to signal when the program could perform certain tasks.  This task was accomplished by setting the variables in terms of 1 and 0.
