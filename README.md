# Coding_Bat_Python
This repository contains solutions to the problems under the python section on Coding Bat. For the last problems, I used object-oriented programming and applied my previous experiences with computer architecture and specifically logic gates.  Similar to logic gates, I assigned variables to 0s and 1s to signal when the program could perform certain tasks. When the variables are "turned on", certain tasks are performed.
