# Coding_Bat_Python
This repository contains solutions to the problems under the python section on Coding Bat. For the last problems, I used object-oriented programming after reviewing the concept. For these last problems, I also applied my computer architecture, specifically logic gates, to signal the program could perform certain tasks. This was accomplished by setting the variables in terms of 1 and 0.
